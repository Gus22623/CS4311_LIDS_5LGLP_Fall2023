# What is LIDS?

The software product to be produced is a Lightweight Intrusion Detection System (LIDS) specifically designed to cater to the needs of the Cyber Experimentation and Analysis Division (CEAD) within the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Analysis Center (DAC). 

LIDS aims to monitor and secure network traffic by identifying and reporting malicious and anomalous packets files within a network. Developed after an extensive needs analysis, the system focuses on efficiency and reliability in intrusion detection. While LIDS will proactively detect potential threats and alert the CEAD security team, it will not perform direct remediation. As a vital component of the DEVCOM Analysis Center's cyber capabilities, LIDS offers top-level benefits such as the reduced risk of data breaches, enhanced network visibility, and improved incident response times. By ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the network, LIDS aims to provide a reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly solution that strengthens the cyber defense posture of the U.S. Army DEVCOM Analysis Center.
